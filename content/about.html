  similar projects on April 25th of the same year. The project

          <h3>Nick Babcock</h3>
          <p>Self proclaimed programming aficionado, Nick's
          expertise lie in software development, web
          development, and languages such as C# and python. His
          role in the project consisted maintaining the source
          control in a git repo and disseminating his knowledge
          on the subject to his teammates. In addition, he
          designed and implemented data logging in the online
          build of Deathmark, so that the developers could view
          where players activated the deathmark and died the
          most. Nick is also the main author of the
          postmortem.</p>
